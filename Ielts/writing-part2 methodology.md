**背诵点**

**Introduction**

**1. Discussion**: 给两方观点，让提出自己的观点。这种情况可以对比两方观点

People have different views about the effectiveness of group study **as opposed to** working alone. While there are some benefits to studying independently, I believe that group work is usually more **productive**.

题目中存在两种观点的时候，使用这种句型。as opposed to——与...截然相反，与...相对。

**2. Opinion**： 给一个陈述，让说自己的观点。这种情况不能说别人说了啥啥啥，要说自己同意、不同意、balanced idea

It is sometimes argued that high school students should be made to do some work in their local communities. I completely agree that this kind of **scheme** would be a good idea.

It is sometimes argued that high school students should be made to do some work in their
local communities. In my opinion, it would be wrong to **force** teenagers to do any kind of
**unsalaried** work.

It is sometimes argued that high school students should be made to do some work in their
local communities. While I disagree with the idea of making such programmes compulsory,
I do believe that **voluntary** community service could benefit young people.

句型：it is somtimes argued that...; scheme——策划，计划；compulsory-unpaid-unsalaried-voluntary

**3. Problem and solution**

It is true that punishments do not always **deter** criminals **from** committing more crimes.
There are various reasons why offenders repeatedly **break the law**, but
governments could certainly take steps to address this issue.

替换词：continue to commit crimes - not deter ciminals fromm committing more crimes; measures to tackle the problems - take steps to address the issue.

**4. Two-part question**

Work plays a **central role** in our lives, and we would all like to feel **fulfilled** professionally.
While a variety of factors may lead to job satisfaction, it would be unrealistic to expect
everyone to be happy at work.

替换词：spend a major part of life at work-work plays a central role in our lives. job satisfaction is an important element of individual well-being-we would all like to feel fulfilled professionally.



**Main Body**

There are several reasons why I would argue against having **compulsory community
service** for **secondary school students**. *Firstly*, the **school curriculum** is already full with
important **academic subjects**, *such as* maths, science and languages. *For example*, I
remember having an **extremely busy timetable** when I was at high school, and it would not
have been possible to add to it. *Secondly*, **students’ performance** in other subjects would
be affected if valuable study time were taken by **charity work or neighbourhood
improvement schemes**. *Finally*, I believe that teenage students would be **reluctant** to take
part in any programme of **obligatory work**, *and this* could lead to **poor motivation** and even
bad behaviour.

*On the other hand*, the **opportunity** to do **voluntary community service** could be extremely
positive for high school students. By making *these* **programmes optional**, schools would
**ensure that only motivated students took part**. *These* young people would **gain valuable
experience** in an **adult working environment**, *which* could help to **build their self confidence**
and **enhance their skills**. Having *such* experience and skills on their CVs could greatly
improve **school leavers’ career prospects**. *For example*, a period of voluntary work
experience might **impress a university admissions officer or a future employer**.

> 1. there are advantages/benefits to doing sth
> 2. 连接词不算在词汇中，所以连接词不用搞得很复杂，只用firstly, secondly, finally, for example就好

### Education
1. 什么样的教育是好的教育

There is still no **unanimous consensus**[共识] on what constitutes a sound teaching methodology. However, in the new **millennuium**[千年，世纪], the best schooling at all three levels, primary, secondary and post-secondary, or tertiary[tertuary education 高等教育], has five common characteristics: A good education encourages students to think independently and critically. It **empowers**[授权，准许] them to evaluate their teacher's performance openly. Students are expected to have their own ideas and not just reqeat what their teachers have told them. Good educational institutions aim to produce students who have **integrity**. These institutions instill not only knowledge, but also high moral values and principles. Education should recognise the correlation and interaction between various disciplines and typically adopt a multi-disciplinary curriculum. In stimulating educational environments, theoretical knowledge and pratical, employable skills go hand in hand. Schools should not be segregated on racial, gender or intellectual grounds.
