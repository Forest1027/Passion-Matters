The line graph **compares** the amount of electricity produced in France using four different sources
of power **over a period of** 32 years.

**It is clear that** nuclear power was **by far the most** important means of electricity generation **over the
period shown**. Renewables provided the lowest amount of electricity in each year.

In 1980, thermal power stations were the main source of electricity in France, generating around
120 terawatt hours of power. Nuclear and hydroelectric power stations produced just under 75
terawatt hours of electricity each, and renewables provided a negligible amount. **Just one year
later**, nuclear power **overtook** thermal power as **the primary source** of electricity.

**Between 1980 and 2005**, electricity production from nuclear power **rose dramatically to a peak of**
430 terawatt hours. **By contrast**, **the figure** for thermal power **fell to** only 50 terawatt hours in 1985,
and **remained at** this level **for the rest of the period**. Hydroelectric power generation **remained
relatively stable**, **at between 50 and 80 terawatt hours, for the whole 32-year period**, but renewable
electricity production **saw only a small rise to approximately** 25 terawatt hours by 2012.
