1. line graph

The line graph **compares** the amount of electricity produced in France using four different sources
of power **over a period of** 32 years.

**It is clear that** nuclear power was **by far the most** important means of electricity generation **over the
period shown**. Renewables provided the lowest amount of electricity in each year.

In 1980, thermal power stations were the main source of electricity in France, generating around 120 terawatt hours of power. Nuclear and hydroelectric power stations produced just under 75 terawatt hours of electricity each, and renewables provided a negligible amount. **Just one year later**, nuclear power **overtook** thermal power as **the primary source** of electricity.

**Between 1980 and 2005**, electricity production from nuclear power **rose dramatically to a peak of** 430 terawatt hours. **By contrast**, **the figure** for thermal power **fell to** only 50 terawatt hours in 1985, and **remained at** this level **for the rest of the period**. Hydroelectric power generation **remained relatively stable**, **at between 50 and 80 terawatt hours, for the whole 32-year period**, but renewable electricity production **saw only a small rise to approximately** 25 terawatt hours by 2012.

2. bar chart

The bar chart **compares** the number of mobile phones sold worldwide by the five most popular
manufacturers **in the years 2009, 2011 and 2013**.

It is clear that Nokia sold the most mobile phones between 2009 and 2011, but Samsung became
the best selling brand in 2013. Samsung and Apple **saw the biggest rises in sales over the 5-year
period**.

In 2009, Nokia sold **close to** 450 million mobile phones, which was almost **double the number of
handsets** sold by the second most successful manufacturer, Samsung. **Over the following four
years**, however, Nokia’s sales figures fell by approximately 200 million units, **whereas** Samsung
saw sales rise by a similar amount. By 2013, Samsung had become the market leader with sales
reaching 450 million units.

The other three top selling mobile phone brands between 2009 and 2013 were LG, ZTE and Apple.
In 2009, these companies sold around 125 million, 50 million and 25 million mobile handsets
respectively, but Apple **overtook** the other two vendors in 2011. In 2013, purchases of Apple
handsets reached 150 million units, while LG saw declining sales and the figures for ZTE rose only
slightly.

3. pie chart

The pie charts compare five categories of household expenditure in the UK and New Zealand in
the years 1980 and 2008.

**It is noticeable that** the proportion of spending on food and drink **fell** in both countries **over the 28-
year period**, while spending on utility bills **rose**. Also, **UK residents** spent a significantly larger
percentage of their household budgets on leisure than their New Zealand **counterparts**.

In 1980, 29% of an average New Zealand household budget **went on** food and drink, while the
**equivalent figure** for a UK home was 23%. By 2008, expenditure on food and drink had fallen by
4% in New Zealand, and by a full 10% in the UK. **By contrast**, both countries saw an increase in
expenditure on utility bills for the average home, from 27% to 31% in New Zealand and from 26%
to 28% in the UK.

Leisure activities **accounted for the highest proportion** of UK household spending in both years, but
only the third highest proportion in New Zealand. In fact, in 2008, New Zealanders spent only **half
as much** in **relative terms** on recreation (17%) **as** UK residents (34%). In both countries, transport
costs and other costs **took roughly 15% and 10% of** household budgets respectively.

4. table

The table compares **the five highest ranking countries** in terms of the numbers of visits and the
money spent by tourists over a period of two years.

It is clear that France was **the world’s most popular tourist destination** in the years 2012 and 2013.
However, the USA **earned by far the most** revenue from tourism over the same period.

In 2012, 83 million tourists visited France, and the USA was **the second most visited country**, with
66.7 million tourists. Spain and China **each received** just under 58 million visitors, while Italy **was
ranked fifth** with 46.4 million tourists. **2013 saw a rise of between 1 and 4 million tourist visits to
each country, with the exception of China, which received 2 million fewer visitors than in the
previous year**.

Spending by tourists visiting the USA increased from $126.2 billion in 2012 to $139.6 billion in
2013, and these figures **were well over twice as high as those** for any other country. Spain **received
the second highest amounts of** tourist revenue, rising from $56.3 billion to $60.4 billion, followed by
France, China and Italy. Interestingly, despite falling numbers of tourists, Chinese revenue from
tourism rose by $1.7 billion in 2013.
