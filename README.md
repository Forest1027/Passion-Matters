# Passion-Matters
Things I do for passion or for seeking passion.

Hey, we only live once. Try your best to find your passion, for passion matters.

**Dec 14th, I learned a sentence from *King's Speach***

- There may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield, but we can only do the right as we see the right, and reverently commit our cause to God.
- 我们面前或许有无尽的黑夜，战争也不仅仅发生于战场，但我们只能做我们认为正确的事情，并向上帝虔诚祈祷。
